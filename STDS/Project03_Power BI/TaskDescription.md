## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing medical data related to heart disease using **Power BI**.
The goal is to transform raw medical data into meaningful insights through preprocessing, analysis, and interactive dashboards.

---

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing was conducted within Power BI and included:
- Cleaning and transforming the dataset
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Converting numeric medical values into standardized and well-known categorical classifications
  (such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels)
- Preparing structured data suitable for analysis and visualization

---

## Data Modeling and Measures
To support advanced analysis:
- Relationships between tables were reviewed and optimized
- Calculated columns were created
- DAX measures were developed to compute key medical indicators and summaries

---

## Dashboard Analysis
The Power BI dashboard analyzes:
- Heart disease distribution among patients
- Demographic characteristics such as age and gender
- Medical risk factors and their relationships
- Comparisons between different patient groups

---

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard consists of **three interactive pages**, including:
- **Page 1:** Overview of heart disease distribution and key indicators
- **Page 2:** Patient demographic analysis
- **Page 3:** Medical risk factors and health attribute relationships

Additional features include:
- Interactive visuals
- Filters and slicers for dynamic exploration
- Clear comparisons between categories
- Visually clear medical insights
