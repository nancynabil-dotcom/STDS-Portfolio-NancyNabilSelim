## What I Learned
This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of data modeling and analysis using Power BI.
I learned how to preprocess data within Power BI, including converting numeric medical values into standardized categorical classifications.
I also gained experience creating calculated columns and measures using DAX and designing multi-page interactive dashboards.

## What Was Challenging
The most challenging aspect was transforming numeric medical values into meaningful categorical ranges based on known medical standards.
Creating accurate DAX measures and ensuring correct relationships between data fields also required careful validation.
Designing a dashboard that presents medical insights clearly across multiple pages was another challenge.

## What I Improved from Previous Tasks
Compared to previous projects, I significantly improved my analytical thinking and data modeling skills.
I moved beyond basic dashboards to more advanced analysis using DAX and multi-page designs.
This project improved my ability to turn complex data into clear and actionable insights.
