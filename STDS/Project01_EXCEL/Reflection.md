## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to perform complete data preprocessing using Microsoft Excel.
I gained hands-on experience with Power Query for cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data.
I also learned how to use Pivot Tables and Excel functions to analyze data and create an interactive dashboard that clearly presents business insights.

## What Was Challenging
The most challenging part of this project was preparing clean and consistent data suitable for dashboard creation.
Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency across categorical fields required careful attention.
Designing a clear and visually balanced dashboard was also challenging, especially when combining multiple KPIs and charts.

## What I Improved from Previous Tasks
This was my first full EXCEL dashboard project, and it helped me build a strong foundation in data preprocessing and visualization.
I improved my understanding of how clean data directly affects the quality of analysis and dashboard results.
This project prepared me to handle more complex data processing tasks in later projects.
