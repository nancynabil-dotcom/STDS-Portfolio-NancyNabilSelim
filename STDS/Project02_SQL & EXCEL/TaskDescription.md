## Project Overview
This project focuses on combining **SQL** and **Microsoft Excel** to perform data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
SQL was used for efficient data cleaning and aggregation, while Excel was used to build an interactive business dashboard.

## Data Preprocessing (SQL)
All data preprocessing steps were performed using SQL, including:
- Cleaning raw data and handling missing values
- Filtering irrelevant records
- Aggregating sales and customer data
- Creating summary queries for business metrics such as total sales and profit
- Structuring query results to be ready for analysis

The final processed results were exported into **CSV files**.

## Data Import and Analysis (Excel)
The generated CSV files were imported into Excel, where:
- Data was validated and reviewed
- Pivot Tables were created to analyze:
  - Sales performance
  - Profit distribution
  - Customer and product behavior
- Calculated fields were added where needed

- **KPI Cards:** Total Sales, Total Profit, Quantity Sold
