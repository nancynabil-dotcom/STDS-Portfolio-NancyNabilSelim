## What I Learned
In this project, I learned how to use SQL for data preprocessing and analysis.
I gained experience writing SQL queries to clean data, filter records, and aggregate results.
I also learned how to export query results into CSV files and integrate them into Excel for further analysis and dashboard creation.

## What Was Challenging
The main challenge was writing accurate SQL queries that produce clean and meaningful results.
Ensuring that the exported CSV files were structured correctly for Excel analysis required careful query design.
Managing the workflow between SQL and Excel was also more complex than working with Excel alone.

## What I Improved from Previous Tasks
Compared to the first project, I improved my ability to handle data preprocessing outside Excel.
I became more efficient in preparing data before visualization and learned how to separate preprocessing and visualization tasks.
This project enhanced my problem-solving skills and improved my confidence in working with multiple tools.
