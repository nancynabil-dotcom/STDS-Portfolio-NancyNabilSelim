## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to create interactive dashboards using Tableau.
I gained experience in data preprocessing for visualization and learned how to build individual charts in separate worksheets.
I also learned how to combine multiple worksheets into dashboards and enhance interactivity using filters and navigation buttons.

## What Was Challenging
Designing dashboards that are both visually appealing and easy to navigate was challenging.
Managing multiple worksheets and ensuring consistency across dashboards required careful planning.
Implementing navigation buttons and clear filter actions also required additional experimentation.

## What I Improved from Previous Tasks
Compared to earlier projects, I improved my dashboard design and storytelling skills.
I became more comfortable working with advanced visualization tools and interactive elements.
This project reflects my growth in creating professional and user-friendly dashboards across different platforms.
