## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating interactive and insightful dashboards using **Tableau**.
The project emphasizes data preprocessing, chart creation, and dashboard design.

---

## Data Preprocessing
Before visualization, data preprocessing steps were performed to:
- Clean the dataset
- Ensure consistent formatting
- Correct data types
- Prepare the data for accurate visualization in Tableau

---

## Chart Creation
Each visualization was created separately in its own worksheet (sheet), including:
- Trend charts
- Category comparison charts
- Distribution and performance visualizations

---

## Dashboard Design
The individual charts were then combined into **three interactive dashboards**, each focusing on different analytical perspectives.

---

## Dashboard Features
The Tableau dashboards include:
- Multiple worksheets combined into dashboards
- Filters and slicers for interactive analysis
- **Navigation buttons** to move between dashboards
- **Clear Filters button** to reset selections
- Clean, organized, and user-friendly layouts
