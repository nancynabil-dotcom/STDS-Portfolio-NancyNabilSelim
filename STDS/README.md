## Projects Summary

### Project 01 – Excel Dashboard
In this project, all data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation were performed entirely using **Microsoft Excel**.
The cleaned data was then analyzed using Pivot Tables and visualized through an interactive Excel dashboard.
This project established a strong foundation in data preparation and dashboard design.

**Key Skills:**
- Data cleaning with Power Query
- Pivot Table analysis
- KPI creation
- Excel dashboard design

### Project 02 – SQL & Excel Dashboard
This project focused on using **SQL** for data preprocessing and aggregation.
The processed results were exported as CSV files and then imported into Excel to build an interactive dashboard.
This project demonstrates the ability to integrate multiple tools within a single analytical workflow.

**Key Skills:**
- SQL queries for data cleaning and aggregation
- Exporting query results to CSV
- Excel-based data analysis and dashboards

### Project 03 – Power BI Dashboard
This project involved analyzing medical data related to heart disease using **Power BI**.
Data preprocessing was performed within Power BI, including converting numeric medical values into standardized categorical classifications.
Advanced analysis was conducted using DAX measures, and the results were presented through a multi-page interactive dashboard.

**Key Skills:**
- Data modeling
- DAX measures
- Power BI dashboard design
- Medical data analysis

### Project 04 – Tableau Dashboards
In this project, **Tableau** was used to create interactive dashboards.
Data preprocessing was completed prior to visualization, and each chart was built in a separate worksheet.
The charts were then combined into three dashboards with filters, navigation buttons, and clear filter functionality.

**Key Skills:**
- Tableau worksheets and dashboards
- Interactive filters
- Navigation buttons
- Visual storytelling
